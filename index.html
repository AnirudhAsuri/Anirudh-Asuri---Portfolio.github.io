            <h2>An amateur game developer.</h2>

            <p>Hey, I'm Anirudh Asuri.
            I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering with a specialization in <span style = "color:rgb(255, 0, 51)">Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</span>, but my true focus lies in Game Development.
            <br>
            <br>
            Game development, to me, is built on passion, discipline, and perseveranceâ€”qualities I take pride in. My fascination with games has always gone beyond just playing them. I've been deeply curious about the underlying systems and mechanics that bring them to life.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am highly dedicated to mastering the craft of GameDev and continuously strive to grow both creatively and technically. Along the way, I've gained valuable experience in collaboration, working with diverse groups of people during my school and college years. I strongly believe that teamwork is at the heart of every successful project.
