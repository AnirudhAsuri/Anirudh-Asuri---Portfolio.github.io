        <h2>Real-Time Adaptive Enemy AI</h2>
        <div align = "center">
            <p>
                Built a lightweight Adaptive AI system for 1v1 enemy behavior in just 2 weeks.
                <br>
                I avoided Machine Learning due to the inherent requirement for data that ML brings.
                <br>
                The system reacts to player actions - such as aggresive attacking - in real-time using simple weighted decision making.
                <br>

        <h2>4 Days GameDev Challenge - Single Room First Person Escape Room</h2>
        <div align = "center">
            <p>
                A compact, first-person Escape Room experience developed in just 4 days.
                <br>
                It is designed to be completed in a single session with minimal UI art for a more raw experience.
                <br>
                The game challenges players to explore, find and solve puzzles within the confines of a single floor, with low lighting.
                <br>
                Extra attention was given to movement mechanics to get the feeling of being stuck in a dark floor across the to the players.

        <h2>Context Steering in 3D</h2>
        <div align = "center">
            <p>
                Context Steering is a navigation AI technique originally developed for top down 2D environments.
                <br>
                This project took this concept and adapted it to a 3D environment.
                <br>
                Generally, people tend to use prebuilt nav-mesh agents for their AI navigation. However, in Unity, using this prevents us from using our own custom movement systems.
                <br>
                This particular problem is what this project hopes to fix.
                <br>
                Context Steering is a lightweight system that uses raycasts to get 2 maps of data regarding the target position and obstacles in the way.
                <br>
                This data is then used to make decisions in real-time.
                <br>
                This project contains a playable demo that uses a custom acceleration based movement system, thus using Context Steering in 3D for the AI Navigation.
                <br>

        <h2>Ponchon</h2>
        <div align = "center">
            <p>
                A fully developed game using the 3D Context Steering demo as a base.
                <br>
                Fun-filled chaotic game about punching your way through levels of capsule enemies!.
                <br>
                This is to be the first full game I release.
                <br>

                A digital version of a fun card game me and my friends play called "Phase 10".
                <br>
                Still in development, but the basic mechanics are all in place.
